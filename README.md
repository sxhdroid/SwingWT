SwingWT

A clone of SwingWT:http://swingwt.sourceforge.net/

SwingWT is a 100% pure Java library which aims to be a free implementation of Swing and AWT. Unlike Swing, it drives native peer widgets for your platform from SWT. 

SwingWT offers many benefits:

*More responsive GUIs and faster startup times
*Less RAM usage for applications
*Many developers prefer the Swing API
*Existing Swing applications don't need to be recoded
*Mature Swing UI designers can be used
*Developers deploying to *nix/Win32 can compile natively with GCJ and the applications can be distributed without a VM. Linux distribution makers could package many existing Java/Swing applications that previously could not be distributed in workable state.
*SWT components can be directly accessed through the API, allowing mix and match (make Eclipse plugins with Swing!)
*All platform benefits such as font sub-pixel decimation for LCD monitors (unavailable in Swing)
*Use Swing on mobile devices!
*The best of both worlds! New Swing components for JClosableTabbedPane, JCoolBar, JTaskTrayItem..
*A FREE implementation of Swing you can redistribute and modify to suit your own requirements
*Insulation from changes to the SWT APIs
*Insulation from differences between SWT platforms
