This file contains details of showstopping bugs that need to be
fixed prior to the next release, along with the current list
of jobs that need to be done on SwingWT.

The jobs are separated into AWT and Swing and given a priority
from 1-3 ( 1 = High, 2 = Normal, 3 = If I can be bothered)

====================================================
URGENT BUGS TO BE FIXED BEFORE NEXT RELEASE: 
====================================================

*. Creating most components with a single string argument
   (eg: JButton, JMenuItem, etc.) should set the action command
   as well.

*. MacOSX thread problems - spawning worker threads seems to orphan 
   them and hang any program???

*. ActionEvents should be spawned for AbstractButton descendants
   when the item state changes (not just ItemEvents).

====================================================
KNOWN BUGS
====================================================

*. 2 If you add a Textarea to a JScrollpane by calling
   JScrollpane.getViewport().add(txt), it isn't picked up as
   a component that can handle it's own scrollbars. You
   need to use the add() method of the JScrollpane (or
   use setViewportView())

*. 2 Vertical toolbars on MacOSX - problems with vertical 
   orientation.

*. 2 Layout with JSplitPanes
    I'm adding a JEditorPane with some HTML content to a JSplitPane.
    In old Swing, it used to automatically fill out the content
    area.  With SwingWT, it just takes up a little corner of the
    content area.
    
*. 2 DefaultListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION:
    selection = new DefaultListSelectionModel ();
    selection.setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION);

    This throws a null pointer, because of
    ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION.
    
*. 2 ListSelectionListener returns JTable instead of ListSelectionModel

====================================================

====================================================
JOBS THAT NEED DOING:
====================================================
 
AWT ================================================

awt.Image.RGBImageFilter:
	3 needs implementing

awt.Font: 
	1 needs work and support adding for LineMetrics/etc (lots of GC-type
	support classes are in (like FontMetrics) - just need using).

awt.dnd.*:
	3 needs to be able to do something useful
	
awt.print.*:
	3 Not implemented (no print interface on SWT/GTK2 at present)
	
awt.geom.*:
	2 And other horrible Java2D stuff needs completing. Great big
	holes in awt.SWTGraphics2DRenderer need doing to handle
	abstract awt.Shape implementors.

awt.event.InputEvent: 
        2 InputEvent.getModifiersEx

awt.event.ActionEvent:
	2 ActionEvent.paramString

awt.Window:
        2 Window.removeWindowFocusListener
        2 Window.addWindowFocusListener

SWING ==============================================

accessibility.AccessibleContext:
	3 Need at least basic subclasses and descriptions

swing.AbstractButton descendants
	1 setBorderPainted(true) should use SWT.BORDER when
	  creating the peer.

swing.JEditorPane: 
	1 scrollToReference(String) missing
	1 getPage() missing

swing.event.HyperLinkEvent
	1 getSourceElement() missing
	1 SimpleAttributeSet ?

swing.event.InternalFrameAdapter
	1 class is missing

swing.tree.DefaultTreeSelectionModel
        2 Needs tying into JTree and implementing properly

swing.JFrame:
	2 setAlwaysOnTop(boolean)/isAlwaysOnTop() - introduced
	in Java 1.5, but useful (check that it really is a member
	of JFrame and not Frame/Window)
	2 setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated stub

swing.JFormattedTextField:
	2 Needs implementing?

swing.JOptionPane:
        1 Currently tracks and stores instance information,
          createDialog/createInternalFrame need to make sense
          of this and create a JDialog

swing.AbstractButton:
        2 AbstractButton.doClick
        2 AbstractButton.getIcon

swing.JButton:
        2 JButton.configurePropertiesFromAction

swing.JToggleButton:
        2 No constructor that accepts Action

swing.JTabbedPane:
        2 insertTab
        2 setSelectedComponent
        2 SCROLL_TAB_LAYOUT

swing.JComponent:
	1 setRectangleToVisible()
        2 listenerList

swing.SwingUtilities:
        2 windowForComponent
